# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Behavior with Responsive Modifiers and Complex Classes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using specific responsive modifiers in combination with complex Tailwind CSS class names. The issue involves unexpected rendering or styling inconsistencies in certain responsive contexts.

## Bug Description
The bug manifests as an unexpected rendering of elements when using responsive modifiers such as `md:`, `lg:`, etc. with more complex class compositions. It seems to be tied to the order or specific combination of classes, rather than any single class itself.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` or equivalent to start the development server.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior in different screen sizes.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully rearranging class order, potentially leveraging Tailwind's utility-first approach for a clearer structure and to isolate the issue. Alternatively, breaking down complex classes into more modular and simpler classes will help to avoid potential interactions which lead to the bug.  The specific solution will depend on the context of the application.
